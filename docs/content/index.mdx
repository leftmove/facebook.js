  Bookface is a TypeScript (or JavaScript) API wrapper for Meta's Graph API. The
  Graph API is Meta's platform for building apps and services that interact with
  their products (i.e. Facebook, Instagram). Bookface is your (opinionated)
  one-stop shop for interacting with the Graph API through a more intuitive,
  organized, and easier syntax.
