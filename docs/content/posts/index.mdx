# Posts

Posts are the core content on Facebook â€” text updates, links, photos, and videos that appear in news feeds and on profiles. This library provides comprehensive tools for managing posts on both user and page profiles.

<Note variant="note">
  You need to be authenticated before you can interact with posts. If you
  haven't set up authentication yet, check out the
  [authentication](/authentication) guide.
</Note>

## Overview

The library handles several types of posts:

- **Text posts**: Simple status updates with a message
- **Link posts**: Posts that include a URL with automatic preview generation
- **Media posts**: Posts with photos or videos
- **Scheduled posts**: Posts that publish at a future date and time

All posts can be created, retrieved, edited, and deleted (where Meta's policies allow).

## Profile Types

### Page Posts

Page posts are the recommended approach for most applications. Pages have full posting capabilities and are designed for business and public use.

<Documentation file="client/posts.ts" abstraction="PagePosts" />

Set up page posting using the following

<Code language="typescript">
```typescript
import Facebook from "bookface";
import type { Config } from "bookface";

const config: Config = { profile: "page", pageIndex: 0 };
const facebook = new Facebook(config);

const post = await facebook.page.posts.publish({
message: "Hello world"
});

````
</Code>

### User Posts

<Note variant="important">
  User profile posting has been heavily restricted by Meta since April 2018.
  Most posting operations will throw errors.
</Note>

User posts are limited to reading existing posts. Publishing, editing, and deleting user posts is no longer supported by Meta's Graph API.

<Documentation file="client/posts.ts" abstraction="UserPosts" />

User posts can only be read, and require special permissions using the following

<Code language="typescript">
```typescript
import Facebook from "bookface";
import type { Config } from "bookface";

const config: Config = { profile: "user" };
const facebook = new Facebook(config);

const posts = await facebook.user.posts.read();
````

</Code>

## Creating Posts

### Text Posts

The simplest type of post contains just a text message using the following

<Code language="typescript">
```typescript
const post = await facebook.page.posts.publish({
  message: "New product update available"
});

console.log({ post });

````
</Code>

### Link Posts

Posts with links automatically generate rich previews with the page's title, description, and thumbnail. Create link posts using the following

<Code language="typescript">
```typescript
const post = await facebook.page.posts.publish({
  message: "This is a link post.",
  link: "https://developers.facebook.com"
});
````

</Code>

You can also post links without additional text using the following:

<Code language="typescript">
```typescript
const post = await facebook.page.posts.publish({
  link: "https://github.com"
});
```
</Code>

### Media Posts

Upload and share photos with your posts. The library supports JPG, PNG, GIF, BMP, and TIFF formats. Upload media using the following

<Code language="typescript">
```typescript
const post = await facebook.page.posts.publish({
  message: "Product photos",
  media: "/path/to/image.jpg"
});

const multipleImages = await facebook.page.posts.publish({
message: "Gallery update",
media: [
"/path/to/photo1.jpg",
"/path/to/photo2.png",
"/path/to/photo3.gif"
]
});

````
</Code>

You can also upload images from Base64 data using the following:

<Code language="typescript">
```typescript
const post = await facebook.page.posts.publish({
  message: "Generated image",
  media: {
    data: "iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAYAAAAfFcSJAAAADUlEQVR42mP8/5+hHgAHggJ/PchI7wAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==",
    type: "png"
  }
});
````

</Code>

### Scheduled Posts

Schedule posts to publish at a future date and time. The scheduled time must be at least 10 minutes in the future using the following

<Code language="typescript">
```typescript
const tomorrow = new Date();
tomorrow.setDate(tomorrow.getDate() + 1);
tomorrow.setHours(9, 0, 0, 0);

const post = await facebook.page.posts.publish({
message: "Scheduled announcement",
schedule: tomorrow
});

console.log("Post scheduled");
console.log({ scheduled: post.scheduled });

````
</Code>

Schedule any type of post using the following

<Code language="typescript">
```typescript
const scheduledLink = await facebook.page.posts.publish({
  message: "Weekly newsletter",
  link: "https://example.com/newsletter",
  schedule: "2024-01-15T10:00:00Z"
});

const scheduledMedia = await facebook.page.posts.publish({
  message: "Product launch",
  media: "/path/to/announcement.jpg",
  schedule: new Date("2024-01-20 14:30:00")
});
````

</Code>

## Checking Scheduled Posts

When you schedule a post, you can check if it has been published using the `ready()` method with the following

<Code language="typescript">
```typescript
const scheduledPost = await facebook.page.posts.publish({
  message: "Future announcement",
  schedule: new Date("2024-01-15T10:00:00Z")
});

console.log("Checking if post is published");
const isPublished = await scheduledPost.ready();
console.log({ published: isPublished });

````
</Code>

<Note variant="note">
  The `ready()` method returns `true` when the scheduled post has been published,
  `false` when it's still scheduled.
</Note>

## Reading Posts

### Get All Posts

Retrieve all posts from a profile using the following

<Code language="typescript">
```typescript
const pagePosts = await facebook.page.posts.read();
console.log("Posts retrieved");
console.log({ count: pagePosts.length });
console.log({ posts: pagePosts });
````

</Code>

### Get Specific Post

Retrieve a single post by its ID using the following

<Code language="typescript">
```typescript
const post = await facebook.page.posts.get({
  id: "123456789_987654321"
});

console.log({ post });

````
</Code>

Get posts by passing another post object using the following

<Code language="typescript">
```typescript
const existingPost = await facebook.page.posts.publish({
  message: "Original post"
});

const retrievedPost = await facebook.page.posts.get(existingPost);
console.log({ retrievedPost });
````

</Code>

## Editing Posts

<Note variant="note">
  You can only edit the text message of posts. Media, links, and scheduling
  cannot be modified after publishing.
</Note>

Update the message of an existing post using the following

<Code language="typescript">
```typescript
const editedPost = await facebook.page.posts.edit({
  id: "123456789_987654321",
  message: "Updated content"
});

console.log("Post updated");
console.log({ success: editedPost.success });

````
</Code>

## Deleting Posts

Remove posts from your profile using the following

<Code language="typescript">
```typescript
const result = await facebook.page.posts.remove({
  id: "123456789_987654321"
});

console.log("Post deleted");
console.log({ success: result.success });
````

</Code>

## Post Object

When you create, read, or modify posts, you'll work with `Post` objects that provide direct methods for interacting with the post. Post objects contain properties like `id`, `message`, `created`, `media`, `link`, `success`, and `scheduled`.

Work with post objects using the following

<Code language="typescript">
```typescript
const post = await facebook.page.posts.publish({
  message: "Hello world"
});

console.log("Post properties");
console.log({
id: post.id,
message: post.message,
created: post.created,
scheduled: post.scheduled
});

````
</Code>

### Direct Post Methods

Post objects have methods that let you interact with them directly using the following

<Code language="typescript">
```typescript
const post = await facebook.page.posts.publish({
  message: "Original message"
});

await post.edit({
  message: "Edited message"
});

await post.remove({});

const details = post.dump();
console.log({ details });
````

</Code>

### Post Comments

Post objects can also be used to work with comments. When comments documentation is available, you'll be able to interact with comments directly through post objects.

## Targeting

Target posts to specific geographic locations using the following

<Code language="typescript">
```typescript
const post = await facebook.page.posts.publish({
  message: "Regional announcement",
  targeting: {
    geo_locations: {
      countries: ["US"],
      cities: [
        { key: "123", name: "New York" },
        { key: "456", name: "Los Angeles" }
      ]
    }
  }
});
```
</Code>

## Error Handling

Handle errors properly by using promise chains with `.catch()` methods with the following

<Code language="typescript">
```typescript
facebook.page.posts.publish({
  message: "Test post",
  schedule: new Date()
})
.then(post => {
  console.log({ post });
})
.catch(error => {
  console.log("Publishing failed");
  console.log({ error: error.message });
});

facebook.user.posts.publish({
message: "This will fail"
})
.catch(error => {
console.log("User posting deprecated");
console.log({ error: error.message });
});

```
</Code>

## Working with Posts

Posts are central to Facebook content management. Use page profiles for full functionality, handle scheduled posts with the `ready()` method, and remember that media uploads happen automatically when you provide file paths. The library handles authentication, token management, and API communication so you can focus on your content.

For advanced use cases, leverage post targeting for geographic distribution, use the post object methods for direct manipulation, and implement proper error handling to manage API limitations gracefully.
