# Publishing

Posts are the main way to interact with Facebook. They can be created, updated, edited, and deleted with Bookface.

Before publishing and interacting with posts though, understanding a few concepts can be useful.

<Note variant="note">
  You'll need to be logged in with credentials in order to do anything with posts. If you haven't done this already, check out the [getting started](/getting-started) guide.
</Note>

## Profile

You can interact with posts on behalf of a [profile](https://www.facebook.com/help/337881706729661/). This can either be a [page](https://www.facebook.com/business/tools/facebook-pages) or a [user](https://www.facebook.com/help/337881706729661/).

The difference between the two is where you post to, and therefore what permissions you need. The `user` profile posts to the user's personal profile, while the `page` profile posts to the one of the user's pages.

## Users

<Note variant="important">
Meta heavily restricts the use of user profiles. It's recommended you use [page profiles](#pages) instead.
</Note>

Publishing from user profiles has been deprecated. The only way to publish posts now is through a [page profile](#pages).

While you can no longer publish, edit, or delete posts from a user profile, Meta still allows you to do a couple of very limited actions with the [special `user_posts` permission](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/permissions/reference/user_posts). However, this permission requires manual approval from Meta, and is not available to everyone.

For more information about the breaking changes made to user profiles by Meta, see the [Graph API changelog](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/changelog/out-of-cycle-changes), and [Meta's announcement post](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/changelog/breaking-changes/).
